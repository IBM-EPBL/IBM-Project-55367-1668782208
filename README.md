#### _Project Description_

> Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food.

The main purpose of the project is to build a model which is used for classifying
the fruit depends on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user
can capture the images of different fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model.
The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre,
Protein, Calories, etc.).It classify an object with higher degree of accuracy by fine tuning the
parameters of the network. The main motto is to reduce the training time and compute
complexity of the network by adding a sub layer after each convolution layer
